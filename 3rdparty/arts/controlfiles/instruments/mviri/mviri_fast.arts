# ARTS setup file for fast MVIRI simulations.
#
# Use this if you want to do fast MVIRI simulations.  It should be a
# good approximation of the exact simulations.
#
# This expects a number of workspace variables to exist and to be set:
# 
# satellite   (String) 	     The name of the satellite. Is
#                      	     used internally to construct
#                      	     file names of the instrument
#                      	     description files. 
# channels    (ArrayOfIndex) Which channels you want.
#                            HIRS Channels 13-19 are shortwave
#                            channels. Simulating them with  
#                            ARTS for thermal radiation only is
#                            pointless. So you probably want 0 to 11
#                            (zero based ARTS indexing)
# views       (ArrayOfIndex) Which views you want.
# hitran_file (String)       Name of HITRAN catalogue file.
