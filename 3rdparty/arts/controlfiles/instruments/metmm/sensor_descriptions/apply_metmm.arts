#DEFINITIONS:  -*-sh-*-

# Creates sensor response following the met-mm system
#
# This file expects that one met-mm definition file has been called, e.g.
# sensor_mhs.arts (which in turn requires prepare_metmm.arts been called
# before).
# In addition, the following workspace variables must exist and be set:
# 
# channels    (ArrayOfIndex) Which channels you want.
#                            Note that this array uses zero-based ARTS
#                            indexing. It can be set to [-1] to select all
#                            channels.
# viewing_angles (ArrayOfIndex) Which views you want.
