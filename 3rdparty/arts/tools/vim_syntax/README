Syntax highlighting in VIM for ARTS controlfiles
------------------------------------------------

This script extracts all WSM, WSV and group names from the given arts binary
and creates a VIM syntax file in $HOME/.vim/syntax/arts.vim . It also creates
a file type detection script in $HOME/.vim/ftdetect/arts.vim

If your arts executable is not in the search PATH, you have to call the script
with the path to arts:

./update-vim-arts-syntax ~/arts/build/src/arts

Remember to rerun the script to add new WSMs and WSVs to the syntax file after
changes happened inside ARTS.
