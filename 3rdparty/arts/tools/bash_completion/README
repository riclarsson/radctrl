Add commandline completion for ARTS in the Bash shell
-----------------------------------------------------

To get the completion working in your current shell run source the
'completion_arts.sh' file in your shell:

source completion_arts.sh

Assuming that the arts binary is in your search PATH, you can now type:

arts --<TAB><TAB>

and you should get a list of the available command line options from
arts. The completion also works if you specify the full/relative path to arts:

~/arts/build/src/arts --<TAB><TAB>

The completion does not only work for command line options, but also for
additional arguments to this options, e.g. you're looking for the description
of a method or variable and only know that the name starts with Doit. So you
type:

arts -d Doit<TAB><TAB>

And you end up with a list of matching names:

DoitCalc                   DoitGetIncoming1DAtm       DoitScatteringDataPrepare
DoitGetIncoming            DoitInit                   DoitWriteIterationFields
